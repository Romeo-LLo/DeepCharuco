training process is not rectified
loss stock as 0.68
using less epoch model can at least give out id point, strange
more data might work


1123
location sometimes get more than 4
id sometimes duplicate or less that 4

set beta = 0.5, model_dict: loss43.pth
Loss: 0.425945	loc_loss: 0.007354	id_loss: 0.837182

set beta = 2 no use
place beta before loc loss, train only id head, id loss stuck at 0.83
try increasing data from 3700 to 7500
no use, still stuck at 0.837

test.show put on id loss, it seems the right prediction has no difference on loss
with wrong prediction, all are 0.83
note that in training process, the value after criterion is divided by batch size already

In model.py, desc head has two extra operation, which is not need,
shut them down, things goes better afterward, beta is set to id loss now


## TODO:
# print((label2D != 0).nonzero(as_tuple=True)) to replace double for loop
